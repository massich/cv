To whom it might concern,

I am writing to apply for a position at Hydromea. I am aware that there are no
open positions listed on your website. Nonetheless, I attempt the long shoot
of asking if you have any none-listed vacancy, since I am in Lausanne for a
short period. I will try to be as concise as possible.

I am a former member of the Girona Underwater vision and Robotics group at CIRS
(ViCOROB). I participated in the first edition of the SAUC-E competition (2006)
with ViCOROB. A colleague and I developed the electronics and firmware for the
sonar system to detect and locate a pinger. I also collaborated in the process of
designing and constructing the marker's dropping system since it was outsourced
to a company I used to intern. After that I followed an Erasmus Mundus
program in computer vision and robotics, followed by a PhD and a postoc both in
medical imaging. Despite working in Medical Imaging field, I kept a relation
with underwater robotics, developing ViCOROB's talent attracting program based
on building underwater robots with kids. We call them R2B2s.

My interest for your company comes from a friend (also from Girona) who did his
master thesis at LIS here in EPFL and shared some time with Dr. Felix Schill
during his postdoctoral. In my friend's words: -If you wanna get back to develop
and do real stuff like before the PhD, you should look into Hydromea. One of his
founders was building crazy stuff. I think he even build his own projector just
for fun, you would love it.

At this point, I would like to go back to develop, build and do things in a team
with a common objective. So, please find attach my CV (short and long versions) and
I remain at your disposition for any questions or remarks. Either by email or short
meeting at EPFL Innovation Park.


Yours faithfully,
Joan Massich.
